# Question 1
Using `async`/`await` over `.then`/`.catch` makes our code for handling promises much more readable. What are the ways in which `async`/`await` is more readable than `.then` and `.catch`?

# Answer
Using `async`/`await` to handle promises makes code more readable than using `.then` and `.catch` as it lets us write asynchronous code in a way that resembles synchronous code. Instead of chaining multiple `.then`/`.catch` blocks with `async`/`await`, code is written in a top-down, step-by-step manner. This makes it easier to understand, avoiding any callback hell that can occur with the `.then`/`.catch` syntax.

To further explain, all promises in JavaScript represent asynchronous tasks and are **non-blocking**. This means that when a promise is in progress, it doesn't prevent the rest of the code from executing. The program continues running other synchronous tasks while waiting for the promise to resolve or reject.

Now, wen you declare a function with the `async` keyword, JavaScript automatically wraps the function's return value in a Promise. Inside the `async` function, we must then use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved. This makes the `await` keyword inside the `async` function **blocking** code. This is part of the reason why `async`/`await` looks more synchronous than the `.then`/`.catch` syntax, even though it's still non-blocking to the rest of the program.

Another reason that `async`/`await` is more advantageous compared to `.then`/`.catch` is in its design. Using `try`/`catch` blocks with `await` statements provides a cleaner and more intuitive way to manage errors, especially when dealing with multiple asynchronous operations. Additionally, `async`/`await` reduces the risk of forgetting to return a new promise in a `.then` block, which can break the chain. By avoiding repetitive callbacks and nested `.then` statements, `async`/`await` makes the code easier to follow and debug.
